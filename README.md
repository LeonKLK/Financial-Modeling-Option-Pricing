Option pricing using numerical method(explicit, implicit, Crankâ€“Nicolson, Monte Carlo).

For the explicit, implicit and Crank Nicolson finite difference method, notice that for the interested range, the error could be huge at the begining and end, where normally won't be reached in the market(5 s.d.).

For Monte Carlo method, this method is the most accurate but the most time consuming.
