This is a final year projet in financial modeling under Physics Department in The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK).

Option pricing using numerical method(explicit, implicit, Crankâ€“Nicolson, Monte Carlo).

For the explicit, implicit and Crank Nicolson finite difference method, notice that for the interested range, the error could be huge at the begining and end, where normally won't be reached in the market(5 s.d.).

For Monte Carlo method, this method is the most accurate but the most time consuming, thus one can always choose the desire range, for his best use of time. Notice that for the random number from a Guassian distribution, we use the Box-Muller method.
